## Project Description

This project is divided into two parts:

1. **Back-end**: Developed using Spring Boot with Java.
2. **Front-end**: Developed using Angular.

### Backend
The backend is built with Spring Boot, a framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications. It provides a robust, scalable, and secure RESTful API to handle the core functionality of the application. Key features of the backend include:

- **API Endpoints**: Expose necessary data and functionality through RESTful endpoints.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to a relational database using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.
- **Security**: Secured with Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization.
- **Configuration**: Managed using Spring Boot’s application properties and environment variables.

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smit-joshi814/hospital-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd back-end
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Access the API**: By default, the backend runs on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend

The frontend is developed using Angular, a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for interacting with the backend services. Key features of the frontend include:

- **Dynamic Views**: Utilize Angular components and services to render data and handle user interactions.
- **Routing**: Implemented for navigating between different views and handling authentication.
- **Forms**: Reactive forms for data entry and validation.
- **HTTP Client**: Communicates with the backend API using Angular’s HttpClient module.

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smit-joshi814/hospital-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd front-end
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: By default, the frontend runs on `http://localhost:4200`.
